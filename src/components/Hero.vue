            MyMonero is a highly scalable, non-custodial, light wallet hosting service. We maintain and service the technology required to support and include Monero in your multi-asset wallet or exchange platform. 
            Our hosting service is built for businesses, but will ultimately benefit the end user. 
            Other light wallet hosting services do exist, but we have built the only highly scalable solution. MyMonero is performance-built to scan large batches of wallets simultaneously, 
            which means consistent performance, even when your user base increases rapidly. <br><br>
            Our solution is built to take care of all the heavy lifting for you and keep Monero running smoothly 24/7. <br>
            Hosting Monero can be immensely costly in terms of machine resources and developer costs. Providing a fast and friendly end user experience with Monero is very challenging due to its 
            hardcore privacy-by-default architecture. Wallets  and exchanges are steadily adopting and supporting Monero. <br><br>

            Forget about building your own infrastructure and use MyMonero to power your Monero functionality. No one understands Monero like we do. We have a team ready to assist you to integrate with MyMonero.
