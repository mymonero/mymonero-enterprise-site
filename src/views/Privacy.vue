<div class="text-xl font-bold">5. Security</div><br>

<!-- ------SECTION------ -->
<div class="text-xl font-bold">6. Your Rights in Relation to Your Information</div><br>

Whether you know it or not, you have the following rights in relation to your information which we collect:
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li><b>Right to Access</b> – You have the right to request copies of the information we hold about you at any time. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you unless your request is “manifestly unfounded or excessive.” Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request and if we do so, we will tell you the reasons for such refusal.</li>
<li><b>Right to Correct</b> – You have the right to have your information rectified where it is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
<li><b>Right to Erase</b> – You have the right to request that we delete or remove your information from our systems.</li>
<li><b>Right to Restrict Our Use of Your Information</b> – You have the right to “block” us from using your information or limit the way in which we can use it.</li>

<li><b>Right to Object</b> – You have the right to object to our use of your information including where we use it for our legitimate interests.</li>
</ul><br>
It is important to remember that, because we collect so little data on you, it will often be difficult to identify which information is yours which could make the exercise of any of the above rights impossible in the circumstances.<br><br>
