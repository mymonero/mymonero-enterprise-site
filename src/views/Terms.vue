<div class="text-xl font-bold">CHOICE OF LAW AND ARBITRATION</div><br>

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE USER TO ARBITRATE
DISPUTES WITH THE PROVIDER AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE USER CAN SEEK RELIEF.<br><br>

If any dispute, controversy or claim arises out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions,
including any question regarding their existence, validity, interpretation, breach or termination (“<b>Dispute</b>”),
it shall be referred, upon written notice given by one party to the other party, to finally resolve such
Dispute by arbitration pursuant to the rules of the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Act, which rules are deemed
to be incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions.<br><br>

ARBITRATION PREVENTS THE USER FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.<br><br>

The tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator nominated by the Provider.<br><br>

The seat of arbitration shall be New York, New York.<br><br>

The language of the arbitration shall be English.<br><br>

Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator, the parties shall bear the costs of the arbitrator, the arbitration
venue and the recording of the proceedings in equal proportions and shall otherwise be responsible for
their own costs.<br><br>

Any dispute between the parties will be governed by these Terms and Conditions and the laws Delaware,
USA, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law
of another jurisdiction.<br><br>

WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, THE USER AND PROVIDER WILL NOT
COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR
PROCEEDING.<br><br>

The arbitrator, the Provider, and the User will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings,
judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for
purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to
make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of
confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the
arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in
connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that
disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.<br><br>

Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions or the Website must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that the User and
the Provider will not have the right to assert the claim.<br><br>

If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason:<br>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li>the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms and Conditions;</li>
<li>severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an
individual basis pursuant to this section; and</li>
<li>to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and
the remainder of this section will be enforceable.<br><br>

<!-- ------SECTION------ -->
<div class="text-xl font-bold">Severability</div><br>

If any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give
effect to the intent of these Terms and Conditions, and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions shall
continue in full force and effect.<br><br>

<!-- ------SECTION------ -->
<div class="text-xl font-bold">No waiver</div><br>

No failure on the part of the Provider to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and
Conditions or indulgence in favour of the User will constitute a waiver of that right or provision.<br><br>

<!-- ------SECTION------ -->
<div class="text-xl font-bold">Assignment</div><br>

The Provider may assign these Terms and Conditions to its parent company, affiliate or subsidiary, or in
connection with a merger, consolidation, or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets.<br><br>

<!-- ------SECTION------ -->
<div class="text-xl font-bold">Entire agreement</div><br>
